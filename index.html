                    <i>"Success does not belong to smart people. Success belongs to those who always try." - B. J. Habibie</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prof. DR (HC). Ing. Dr. Sc. Mult. Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie (B. J. Habibie), also called 
                    Rudy Habibie is the 3rd President of Indonesia and an aerospace engineer. Less than three 
                    months after his inauguration as the seventh vice president in March 1998, he succeeded Suharto 
                    who resigned after 31 years in office. His presidency is seen as a landmark and transition to the 
                    Reformation era. Upon becoming president, he liberalized Indonesia's press and political party 
                    laws, and held an early democratic election three years sooner than scheduled, which resulted in 
                    the end of his presidency.

                <h3>Studies and Career in Europe</h3>
                <p>
                    Habibie went to Delft, the Netherlands, to study aviation and aerospace at the Technische 
                    ogeschool Delft (Delft University of Technology), but for political reasons (the West New Guinea 
                    dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia), he had to continue his study at the Technische 
                    Hochschule Aachen (RWTH Aachen University) in Aachen, Germany.[12] In 1960, Habibie received an 
                    engineer's degree in Germany with the title Diplom-Ingenieur. He remained in Germany as a research 
                    assistant under Hans Ebner at the Lehrstuhl und Institut für Leichtbau, RWTH Aachen to conduct 
                    research for his doctoral degree
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1962, Habibie returned to Indonesia for three months on sick leave. During this time, he was 
                    reacquainted with Hasri Ainun, the daughter of R. Mohamad Besari. Habibie had known Hasri Ainun 
                    in childhood, junior high school and in senior high school at SMA Kristen Dago (Dago Christian 
                    Senior High School), Bandung. The two married on 12 May 1962, returning to Germany shortly 
                    afterwards. Habibie and his wife settled in Aachen for a short period before moving to 
                    Oberforstbach. In May 1963 they had a son, Ilham Akbar Habibie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Habibie later found employment with the railway stock firm Waggonfabrik Talbot, where he became 
                    an advisor in designing train wagons.[16] Due to his work with Makosh, the head of train 
                    construction offered his position to Habibie upon retirement three years later, but Habibie 
                    refused the position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1965, Habibie delivered his dissertation in aerospace engineering and received the grade of 
                    "very good," giving him the title Doktoringenieur (Dr.-Ing.). The same year, he accepted Hans 
                    Ebner's offer to continue his research on Thermoelastisitas and work toward his Habilitation, but 
                    he declined the offer to join RWTH as a professor. His thesis about light construction for 
                    supersonic or hypersonic states also attracted offers of employment from companies such as Boeing 
                    and Airbus, which Habibie again declined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Habibie did accept a position with Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm in Hamburg. There, he developed 
                    theories on thermodynamics, construction, and aerodynamics known as the Habibie Factor, Habibie 
                    Theorem, and Habibie Method, respectively. He worked for Messerschmitt on the development of the 
                    Airbus A-300B aircraft. In 1974, he was promoted to vice president of the company.

                <p>
                    In January 1998, after accepting nomination for a seventh term as President, Suharto announced 
                    the selection criteria for the nomination of a vice president. Suharto did not mention Habibie by 
                    name, but his suggestion that the next vice president should have a mastery of science and 
                    technology made it obvious he had Habibie in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In that year, in the midst of the Asian Financial Crisis, this suggestion was received badly, 
                    causing the rupiah to fall. Despite this, Habibie was elected as vice president in March 1998.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 21 May 1998, just two months into Habibie's vice presidency, Suharto announced his resignation. 
                    Habibie, as the Constitution says, succeeded him as president. The following day, Habibie 
                    announced the Development Reform Cabinet, which removed some of the most controversial ministers 
                    in Suharto's last cabinet while maintaining others - with no major figures from the opposition. 
                    Within days of his appointment, he asked his relatives to resign from government positions, 
                    promised an early election, repealed some legislation, and ordered the release of political 
                    prisoners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under Habibie, Indonesia made significant changes to its political system that expanded 
                    competition and freedom of speech. Shortly after taking office, in June 1998, Habibie's 
                    government lifted the Suharto-era restriction on political parties and ended censorship by 
                    dissolving the Information Ministry. He also quickly committed to holding democratic elections, 
                    albeit on an initially vague timetable. In December, he proposed political reform laws that were 
                    passed by the legislature and MPR. These laws set elections for December 1999, reduced the number 
                    of seats in parliament held by the military, and barred political activity by civil servants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, political opponents criticized Habibie for allowing the military to retain some seats in 
                    parliament, and taking little action on other military and judicial reforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Habibie's government also passed laws which granted significant autonomy to regional governments, 
                    namely at the regency and city level. The laws resulted in indirect elections for mayors and 
                    regents, and allowed local legislatures to hold said executives accountable, though it was not 
                    implemented until after his presidency.
